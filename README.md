# The Movies@Mariana

## Prompt

Mariana Tek is hosting a series of events calledThe Movies@Mariana Tek this summer for camaraderie purposes. We want to be as democratic as possible, so each night we will have 3 choices that we can vote on. We need to create a small application where everyone can view the movies on the schedule, separated by date. These movies should be in a list with the following information:

- Title
- Poster
- Genre(s)
- Rating
- Year Release
- Metacritic Rating
- Runtime

There should be one filter and one search. The filter should be by Genre. It should be a dropdown list, populated with all genres of movies currently in our list and it should hide all movies that do not match the selected genre when clicked. Bonus points if it allows for multiple selections.

The search should be by Title. It's should be a text input that, with each character, shows each movie that matches the current string and hides each movie that doesn't.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
